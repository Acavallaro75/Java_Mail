## Project Description
The Java Mail project uses the Java Mail API and allows users to send emails to others using the code implemented. Users can send emails from the application to any other email address that they enter.

## Getting Started
Upon cloning the project, open the Main.java file and edit the following fields:
- Recipient: the email address the email will be sent to
- Sender: the email address the email will be sent from
- Password: the password of the sender's email address
- Subject: the subject of the email
- Body: the contents within the body of the email

Note that your antivirus may prevent outbound mail from an unknown source from sending the email. You can pause this feature on your antivirus and allow the program to run.
